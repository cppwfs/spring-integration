[[null-safety]]
= Null Safety

The codebase is annotated with JSpecify annotations to declare the nullability of its APIs, fields, and related type usages, following Spring Framework's efforts to add null safety to the platform.
Reading Spring Framework's https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/null-safety.html#null-safety-guidelines-nullaway[Null-safety reference documentation] is highly recommended to get familiar with these annotations and their semantics.

The primary goal of this null-safety arrangement is to prevent `NullPointerException` from being thrown at runtime through build-time checks and to use explicit nullability as a way to express the possible absence of a value.
